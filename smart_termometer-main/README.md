# ESP Temperature Sensor with Telegram Integration
This project utilizes an ESP microcontroller to read temperature data from a sensor and sends the data to a specified Telegram chat using the Telegram API.
## Features
 • Reads temperature data using a temperature sensor connected to the ESP device.
 • Utilizes ESP's Wi-Fi capabilities to connect to the internet and send data.
 • Integrates with the Telegram API to send temperature updates to a designated chat or user.
## Requirements
 • ESP microcontroller (e.g., ESP32, ESP8266)
 • Temperature sensor (e.g., DS18B20, DHT11, DHT22)
 • Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
 • Telegram Bot Token (for accessing Telegram API)
 • Wi-Fi access
## Setup
 ### Hardware Setup:
 • Connect the temperature sensor to the ESP microcontroller following the appropriate pin connections.
 ## Telegram Bot Setup:
 • Create a Telegram bot using BotFather on Telegram.
 • Obtain the bot token generated by BotFather.
  Software Configuration:
 • Clone or download this repository.
 • Open the project in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
 • Update the config.h file with your Wi-Fi credentials and Telegram bot token.
  Upload Code:
 • Compile and upload the code to your ESP device.
### Usage
 • Power up the ESP device.
 • Once connected to Wi-Fi, the ESP device will start reading temperature data from the sensor.
 • The temperature data will be sent to the configured Telegram chat at regular intervals.
